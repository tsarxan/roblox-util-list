# Welcome
**REI** is a documentation providing information about multiple known and unknown cheats (internal & external) and utilities from the **Roblox Platform**.

> **Note**: I don't condone cheating or illegitimate usage of tools that allow execution on **Roblox's** Luau VM however these tools have many cases from preserving games from deletion to helping developers figure out real-time issues with games that require client execution rather than server execution.

### Synapse X
> This exploit is **Discontinued**

One of the longest exploits that was running which ended up discontinuing in 2024 for potentially a wide variety of reasons (conspiracies) but primarily because they ended up publicly stating they got an offer from **Roblox** themselves.

There is currently no way to purchase a license for **Synapse X** currently.

To access their website plese go to here: https://synapsesoftworks.llc/ and https://x.synapse.to/


#### Misc Information

The known developers of Synapse X currently was 3dsboy08, brack4712, Louka, DefCon42, and Eternal.

### SirHurt
To my knowledge this is the longest exploit that has been running, developed by Spook and ex-dev Aero. This exploit was reliable however recently there has been stability issues.

To access their website plese go to here: https://www.sirhurt.net/

#### CWs:
Allegedly the owner of SirHurt (Spook) was said to be a Groomer however evidice of this is lacking and had multiple conflicting images, the (Old) V3rmillion & WeAreDevs thread of the CW is deleted as 1 platform shutdown access and the other has deleted their CW section.

## Execution Methods
This is the entire list of either known or used execution methods for exploits, this also might contain a few unused or nonviable execution methods.

### Bytecode Conversion
> The other name(s) for **Bytecode Conversion** is **Bytecode Transpiler** & **Bytecode Compiliation**.

**Bytecode Conversion** is an execution method which relies on the usage of Converting normal **Lua(u) 5.1 Bytecode** into **Roblox Luau Bytecode**.

The primary reason why this is widely used is because **Bytecode Conversion** is easier to develop compared to alternatives (CLVMs & Proto Conversion) and is potentially the fastest one currently used in mainstream exploits.

**Bytecode Conversion** has been used in many exploits such as Calamari, Artemis, Argon, ...

**Sources**:
1. **Imperious/Calamari**: A source leaked in 2019 (?) built by the **Calamari Team**, is potentially the father of almost every exploit. 
2. **Ballistic Source**: A source leaked in 2024  built by **Zayn & Ethan** and is the mother of almost every exploit & primarily known as the base of **Artemis**
3. **Hyperion**: Not to be confused with Hyperion (Anti-Tamper), it's a base developed **Gogo9211** & others.
4. **Headhunter v2**: A source released in 2021 (?) built by **Fishy**, was a popular base after the inlining update from **Roblox** themselves.


### Proto Conversion
**Proto Conversion** is an execution method used in many older exploits, functions by feeding a script into a **Lua(u) VM** and grabbing the compiled **Proto** from that **VM** and converting it into a working **Proto** which is compatible with **Roblox's VM**.

**Proto Conversion** is potentially the oldest execution method which was widely used amongst popular exploits like **ABC** and **XYZ**.

**Sources**:
1. **ABC**: xyz
2. **ABC**: xyz

### CLVMs
> There is multiple variations of **CLVMs** such as **RVM**, **HBVM**, and **OVM**, these all vary in how they're developed and may have different performance across devices.

**CLVMs** take potentially the longest amount of time to develop how ever it does redeem itself in certain cases. **CLVMs** will usually recreate the **Luau VM** from **Roblox** itself however others might function differently.

**Sources**:
1. **Synapse 2019**: A source leaked in late 2019 from the **Synapse X Team**, this was potentially the biggest exploit leak ever including not just the Execution itself but also other sources along with Synapse.
2. **OVM2**: A source released in 2017 by **Rain** and a few other developers was potentially the first public source of a CLVM.


### LBIs



### Wrappers



### Luac



## Notes
1. The difference(s) between **Old Bytecode** and **Roblox Bytecode** is that **Roblox Bytecode** has certain features which protects itself such as Compressing (LZ4) and Hashing (BLAKE3) itself while **Old Bytecode** hasn't gotten these features/modifications.
